        This site was built to demonstrate the skills i have aquired during the past few days. <br>
        In this site you find information about builds i have played and might play in the future, <br>
        in a game called Path of Exile, in the latest league called Ritual. If you dont know <br>
        what this game is then you will just find it to be some mumbo jumbo :D <br>
        Have fun !
